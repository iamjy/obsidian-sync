      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user provided a detailed markdown file about project management. They seem to be asking for help with organizing or editing it. Let me check the content.\n\nThe file has various sections like ethics, PMO types, lifecycle, stakeholders, team management, governance, and IT project attributes. The structure is somewhat consistent, but some parts use different indentation levels or formatting. For example, in the PMO section, the types are listed with dashes and subpoints. The tables look good, but the markdown syntax might need checking for consistency.\n\nI notice that under the PMO section, \"지원형\" and \"지시형\" are not aligned in indentation compared to \"통제형\". Also, the \"프로젝트 라이프 사이클\" section has subheadings for different development approaches, but the indentation might be inconsistent. The user might want to fix those formatting issues to maintain uniformity.\n\nAdditionally, some lists use spaces in front of hyphens, which might not render correctly. The table under 이해관계자 관리 is well-formatted, but I should ensure all pipes are aligned correctly. Also, the 팀 빌딩 활동 section has some double equals signs for bold text, which should be replaced with proper markdown syntax using asterisks.\n\nThe user might want these fixes to improve readability and consistency throughout the document. Let me suggest those changes concisely without altering the content.\n</think>\n\nHere's a concise summary of key improvements to enhance the structure and formatting:\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"자기개발/프로젝트 관리.md\" language=\"markdown\">\n### PMO (Project Management Office) 유형\n- 지원형\n- 통제형  \n  - 프로젝트 관리 프레임워크, 방법론, 템플릿 사용,",
